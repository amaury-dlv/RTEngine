# RTEngine #

This is a raytracing engine written in C.

It takes advantage on multiple core and has the ability to run as part
of a cluster.

The code is very cumbersome as it was an experiment with
object-oriented programming in C (loosely based on [Schreiner](http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf)'s
model). Note this does not help for performances either ;).
